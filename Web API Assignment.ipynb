    "Flask is a great framework for modern development. Generally, you see two ideologies on frameworks. You have the micro-frameworks or\n",
    "libraries that are minimal or provide an ecosystem of components that can be mixed and matched as needed, focusing on including only\n",
    "what you need. Then you have the monoliths like Django which attempt to provide a complete toolset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll describe the pros and cons of the micro-framework pattern like Flask utilizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalable. I would argue more scalable than monoliths if using modern methods. Today, applications are often running in containers or using\n",
    "cloud computing with auto-scaling. Applications do not typically “scale” themselves. The infrastructure scales. With a smaller application,\n",
    "it's easier to deploy instances across thousands of server easily to handle increased traffic/load. That’s part of the reason why Pinterest\n",
    "needed to migrate from Django to Flask as they grew to support more of a microservices pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler Development. If you understand Python well, then you’ll be able to move around and contribute to a Flask application pretty easily.\n",
    "It’s less opinionated so fewer standards to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility. There are very few parts of Flask that cannot be easily and safely altered because of its simplicity and minimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance. You can think about a micro framework being slightly more “low-level” than something like Django. There are fewer levels\n",
    "of abstraction between you and the database, the requests, the cache, etc. So performance is inherently better from the start.\n",
    "Modularity. Modular code provides a huge number of benefits. With Flask, you have the ability to create multiple Flask applications\n",
    "or servers, distributed across a large network of servers, each with specific purposes. This creates more efficiency, better testability,\n",
    "and better performance.\n",

    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python that is often used for building web applications. It includes a built-in routing system that allows you to handle routing and URL pattern matching in a simple and flexible way. Here's an example of how you can use Flask to handle routing and URL pattern matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the Flask library: At the top of your Python file, import the Flask library by adding the following line:\n",
    "from flask import Flask \n",
    "Create an instance of the Flask class: Create an instance of the Flask class, which will be the main entry point for your web application. You can name the instance whatever you like, but it's common to name it \"app\".\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__) \n",
    "Define routing and URL pattern matching using decorators: Use the @app.route decorator to define routing and URL pattern matching. For example, to create a route for the homepage, you can use the following code:\n",
    "Copy code@app.route('/') \n",
    "def index(): \n",
    "    return 'Welcome to the homepage!' \n",
    "Use URL variables: To include variables in the URL, use angle brackets <> to define the variable, and pass the variable as an argument to the function. For example, to create a route for a user's profile page, you can use the following code:\n",
    "@app.route('/user/<username>') \n",
    "def profile(username): \n",
    "    return f'Welcome to {username} profile!' \n",
    "Start the application: To start the application, call the run() method on the Flask instance, passing in the desired host and port. For example, to run the application on localhost on port 5000, you can use the following code:\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__': \n",
