    "page or a dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling POST-Redirect-GET pattern: The POST-Redirect-GET (PRG) pattern is a common design pattern used in web applications\n",
    "to prevent data from being resubmitted when the user refreshes the page after submitting a form. After handling a POST request\n",
    "(e.g., form submission) on the server side, it is a good practice to redirect the user to a different URL using redirect().\n",
    "This way, if the user refreshes the new page, the browser will send a GET request instead of resubmitting the original POST request.\n",
    "\n",
    "User authentication and authorization: Redirecting is often used in the context of user authentication and authorization.\n",
    "For example, if a user attempts to access a restricted page without being logged in, the application might redirect them\n",
    "to a login page. After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the original restricted page.\n",
    "\n",
