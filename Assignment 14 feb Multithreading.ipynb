    "For certain applications, performance and concurrency can be improved by using multithreading.\n",

    "Simplified coding of remote procedure calls and conversations\n",

    "in separate threads than to manage them from the same thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneous access to multiple applications\n",
    "Your BEA Tuxedo clients can be connected to more than one application at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced number of required servers\n",
    "Because one server can dispatch multiple service threads, the number of servers to start for\n",
    "your application is reduced. This capability for multiple dispatched threads is especially\n",

    "Disadvantages\n",
    "Difficulty of writing code\n",

    "in the former case, to identify and verify root causes when errors occur.\n",
